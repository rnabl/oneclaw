# Task ID: 5
# Title: Inject SOUL.md into Chat Prompts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify conversation system to inject SOUL.md content into system prompts for personality consistency
# Details:
Update `src/conversation.rs` to load SOUL.md content and prepend to system prompt. Add lazy loading to avoid reading file on every request. Inject only into chat prompts, not workflow or heartbeat prompts initially.

# Test Strategy:
A/B test: Compare chat responses without SOUL.md vs with SOUL.md - personality and tone should be noticeably different and consistent with SOUL.md content

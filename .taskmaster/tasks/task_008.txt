# Title: Initialize User Memory System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create empty MEMORY.md file and directory structure for user-specific memory storage

Create `~/.oneclaw/` directory structure on first run. Initialize empty `MEMORY.md` file. Create `src/memory.rs` module with `init_memory_file()` function to set up user directory and empty memory file if they don't exist.

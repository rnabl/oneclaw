# Task ID: 18
# Title: Create Sub-Agent Executor Manifest
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Define executor schema, pricing, and rate limits for sub-agent spawning
# Details:
Create `executors/llm_subagents.json` with JSON schema defining: input parameters (agents array, timeout), output format, pricing ($0.01 base + $0.005/agent), rate limits, and safety constraints.

# Test Strategy:
Validate JSON schema is valid, pricing structure matches PRD requirements ($0.01 + $0.005/agent), rate limits are reasonable

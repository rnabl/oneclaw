# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality to append learned facts to MEMORY.md after each conversation
# Details:
Implement `append(fact: &str)` function in memory.rs to append timestamped facts to MEMORY.md. After each chat interaction, prompt LLM to generate "what to remember about this user" and append to memory file with timestamp.

# Test Strategy:
Test conversation where user states preference (e.g., "I prefer bullet points"), verify fact is appended to MEMORY.md with timestamp

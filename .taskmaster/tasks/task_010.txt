# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Memory Compression
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Add logic to compress MEMORY.md when it exceeds token limits
# Details:
Implement `compress()` function in memory.rs to summarize MEMORY.md when it exceeds 3k tokens. Use LLM to compress old memories while preserving important user preferences and facts.

# Test Strategy:
Create large MEMORY.md file (>3k tokens), trigger compression, verify output is shorter but preserves key user preferences

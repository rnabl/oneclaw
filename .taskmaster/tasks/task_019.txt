# Task ID: 19
# Title: Test Parallel Sub-Agent Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Verify sub-agents execute in parallel and provide expected performance benefits
# Details:
Test spawning 3 agents with simple tasks, measure execution time. Must complete in <20s vs 30s+ serial. This is a critical gate - if sub-agents aren't faster, pivot approach.

# Test Strategy:
Performance test: Spawn 3 sub-agents, measure total execution time, verify 2-3x speedup over serial execution

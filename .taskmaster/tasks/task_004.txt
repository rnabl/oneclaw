# Task ID: 4
# Title: Add SHA2 and File System Dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add required Rust dependencies for file hashing and compression
# Details:
Add to Cargo.toml: sha2 = "0.10" for file hashing, tar = "0.4" for snapshots, flate2 = "1.0" for gzip compression. Update imports in agent_os.rs module.

# Test Strategy:
Verify cargo build succeeds, dependencies resolve correctly, and hash functions are available in agent_os module

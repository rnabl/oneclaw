# Task ID: 22
# Title: Test 4-Turn Progressive Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Verify complete progressive workflow with caching and no redundant API calls
# Details:
Test full flow: Turn 1 "Find 100 HVAC in Denver" → calls Apify, stores in state. Turn 2 "Who would you analyze?" → filters cached list. Turn 3 "Which best for me?" → ranks cached. Turn 4 "Run audits" → spawns sub-agents on top 10. No redundant API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: Complete 4-turn workflow, verify no duplicate API calls, user can steer each step, cached data is used appropriately

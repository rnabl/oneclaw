# Task ID: 21
# Title: Add Conversation State Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement state management for progressive multi-turn workflows
# Details:
Update `conversation.rs` to add `state: HashMap<String, Value>` to ConversationContext. After Turn 1, store results in context.state["businesses"]. Enable LLM to reference cached data in subsequent turns.

# Test Strategy:
Test multi-turn: Turn 1 stores data in state, Turn 2 references cached data without re-fetching, verify state persists across turns

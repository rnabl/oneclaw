# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Lazy Loading for Skills
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add conditional loading of SKILLS.md sections based on message content
# Details:
Update agent_os.rs to implement lazy loading: if message contains "email" keywords, load only email section from SKILLS.md. If contains "research", load research section. This optimizes token usage.

# Test Strategy:
Test with different message types: "email" messages should load email skills only, "research" messages should load research skills only

# Task ID: 14
# Title: Test Smart Workflow Routing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Verify LLM uses SKILLS.md benchmarks to make intelligent workflow choices
# Details:
Test routing logic: "Find 100 businesses" should trigger LLM to reference Apify from SKILLS.md table. "Find 3 and analyze" should reference Browser or sub-agents. LLM must explicitly mention benchmarks in reasoning.

# Test Strategy:
Test queries: High-volume requests should reference Apify, detailed analysis should reference Browser, verify LLM explains choice using SKILLS.md data

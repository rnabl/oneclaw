# Task ID: 17
# Title: Create Sub-Agent Executor Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Rust executor for spawning parallel LLM sub-agents
# Details:
Create `src/executors/llm_subagents.rs` with executor that parses params (agents array, timeout), spawns tokio tasks for parallel execution, each calling LLM with isolated context. Return format: {results: [...], succeeded: N, failed: M}.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test: Spawn 3 sub-agents with simple tasks, verify parallel execution completes in <20s vs 30s+ serial execution

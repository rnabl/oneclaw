# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement File Versioning System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add versioning for Agent OS markdown files with hash-based change detection
# Details:
Add `version_files()` function to agent_os.rs that hashes all 5 .md files, compares with previous hashes, bumps version if changed. Use semantic versioning (1.0.0 → 1.1.0 for changes).

# Test Strategy:
Test: Edit SOUL.md, verify version bumps from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, unchanged files don't trigger version bump
